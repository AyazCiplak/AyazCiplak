# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ayaz!
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a junior-year undergraduate B.SC Computer Science student at McGill University.
- ðŸŒ± I'm interested in a variety of technologies, notably those related to web development (React.js, Java, Spring, etc.) and to data science/ML applications (Python, PyTorch, Jupyter, etc.) Most recently, I completed a machine learning model used to predict the behaviour of local sea levels.
