# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ayaz
- ðŸ‘€ I'm an undergraduate B.SC Computer Science student at McGill University.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm learning to develop SPAs, more specifically with the React.JS framework. In the future, I'm planning on learning more about back-end JavaScript frameworks and databases, in order to develop larger, full-stack applications.
